    <h2 id="fundamentals-of-html">Fundamentals of HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of web development, serving as the foundation for creating
        web pages and applications. It allows developers to structure content with a range of elements and tags, such as
        <em>p</em> for paragraphs, <em>a</em> for links, and <em>img</em> for images.
    </p>
    <p>
        These elements tell web browsers how to display content, enabling the creation of diverse and interactive web
        experiences. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, emphasizing the importance of properly
        structuring and categorizing content to ensure accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

    <h3>Structure & Elements</h3>
    <p>
        HTML documents are structured using a nested hierarchy of elements, starting with the html element that
        encapsulates the entire document. Within this, the <em>head</em> section contains meta-information like the
        title and links to CSS files, while the <em>body</em> section hosts the content visible to users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elements, represented by tags, define different parts of a webpage, such as headings (<em>h1</em> through
        <em>h6</em>), paragraphs (<em>p</em>), and lists (<em>ul</em>, <em>ol</em>). This structure is fundamental for
        creating organized and accessible web content, allowing browsers to render pages correctly.
    </p>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>HTML</strong></td>
            <td>This is the root element of an HTML page. It wraps all the content on the entire page. It is sometimes
                known as the root element.
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Head</strong></td>
            <td>A container for all the head elements relating to metadata. These typically include title, link, meta,

    <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
    <p>
        Semantic HTML involves using specific HTML tags that provide meaning to the web content, helping both browsers
        and developers understand the purpose and structure of web documents. Unlike stylistic uses of elements (e.g.,
        using <em>b</em> for bold text), semantic elements like <em>article</em>, <em>aside</em>, <em>footer</em>, and
        <em>nav</em> describe the role of the content in the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        This practice improves SEO, accessibility, and maintainability, as it makes the structure of web pages more
        logical and easier to interpret by assistive technologies and search engines.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="body-content">
    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <p>
        HTML tables are a way to display data in a grid format, composed of rows and columns. Created with the
        <em>table</em> element, tables are structured using <em>tr</em> for table rows, <em>td</em> for table data
        cells, and <em>th</em> for header cells that define column or row headings. Tables can include attributes to
        control spacing, border thickness, and alignment, making them versatile for displaying anything from simple
        lists to complex data sets. However, for non-tabular data or complex layouts, CSS-based layouts are recommended
        for better accessibility and flexibility.
    </p>

    <h2 id="fundamentals-of-css">Fundamentals of CSS</h2>
    <p>
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful tool that defines the look and feel of HTML content on the web. By
        separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can achieve a high degree of control over layout,
        colors, fonts, and responsiveness across different devices. CSS syntax consists of selectors (identifying the
        HTML elements to style) and declarations (defining how the elements should be styled), all contained within
        style sheets. This separation of concerns not only makes websites visually engaging but also enhances
        maintainability and reusability of code.

<div class="body-content">
    <h3>Selectors & Visual Rules</h3>
    <p>
        CSS selectors are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style. From simple selectors that target
        elements by type, ID, or class, to complex selectors that apply styles based on an element's state or its
        relationships with other elements, selectors are fundamental to applying CSS styles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visual rules, defined within curly braces after the selector, specify the styles to be applied, such as color,
        font size, margin, and padding. Understanding CSS selectors and how to effectively apply visual rules is crucial
        for creating visually compelling and structurally sound web pages.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="body-content">
    <h3>Box Model</h3>
    <p>
        The CSS Box Model is a conceptual framework that describes how every element on a web page is rendered as a
        rectangular box. This model encompasses margins (space outside the border), borders (the outer edge of the
        element), padding (space between the border and the content), and the content area itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The box model is fundamental in CSS layout, as it determines how elements interact with each other and how much
        space they occupy. Understanding and manipulating the box model is essential for precise control over layout and
        spacing in web design.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="body-content">
    <h3>Display & Positioning</h3>
    <p>
        In CSS, the display and positioning properties determine how elements are laid out on the page. The <strong>display</strong>
        property specifies whether an element is treated as a <u>block</u> (occupying its own line), <u>inline</u>
        (flowing with text), or other formats like flex and grid that provide advanced layout capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>position</strong> property, on the other hand, defines how an element is positioned within its
        parent container. Elements can be positioned <u>statically</u> (the default), <u>relatively</u> (relative to its
        normal position), <u>absolutely</u> (relative to the nearest positioned ancestor), or <u>fixed</u> (relative to
        the viewport).
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding these properties is crucial for creating responsive and visually appealing web layouts.
